# jlozovei dot github dot io
Hey there, nice to have you here! :smile:

This is the site for my open source portfolio. Here you'll find some nice projects I've made to the community. If you're looking for my commercial portfolio, you should try [jlozovei.dev/portfolio](https://jlozovei.dev/portfolio).

The repo only contains the source code - to properly view the projects, go to [jlozovei.github.io](https://jlozovei.github.io).


## :game_die: Commercial x Open source portfolio
I call **commercial portfolio** the projects I've done as a freelancer front-end developer. They include some websites, web apps, logo design and visual ID creation. The main goal of those projects is money (and also help the people who asked for the project) :money_with_wings:.

And the **open source portfolio** is the list of projects I've done to the community - no "money-based". Those projects could be a study case, a nice tool or a code that would help someone around the world :octocat:.


## :gem: Stack
This project is made with simple HTML + vanilla JS, with some nice CSS animations/transitions. Nothing special, just a list to easilly find the projects.

I'm using [npm](https://npmjs.com/) as the package manager, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as my CI/CD and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the host.
